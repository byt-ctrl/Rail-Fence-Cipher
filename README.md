# Rail Fence CipherðŸš§

**â†’**This project implements a text encryption and decryption tool using the Rail Fence Cipher technique. It features a user-friendly interface for processing text, retaining spaces, and restoring original casing.

## Features

- Encrypt plaintext using Rail Fence Cipher
- Decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext
- Retains spaces and original casing for seamless text transformation
- Validates user input and ensures minimum rails for encryption/decryption

## Logic

**â†’** The Rail Fence Cipher works by arranging the input text diagonally across a specified number of rails in a zigzag pattern. The encrypted text is obtained by reading characters row by row. For decryption, the zigzag pattern is reconstructed using placeholders to determine the arrangement and retrieve the original text.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python
2. Follow the menu prompts:
   - Option 1: Encrypt a message
   - Option 2: Decrypt a message
   - Option 3: Exit the program

1 . Encrypt
2 . Decrypt
3 . Exit
Enter choice (1/2/3) : 1
Enter plain text : Hello World
Enter number of rails (minimun 2) : 2
Encrypted Text :  Hlool Elwrd
